I used pointers for most of my functions, and I will change that later. I used pointers because at first the return value cannot fit the struct that I created. I will probably fix that later.
I am writing the inverse function right now, and I am not sure if I can finish the adjoin ontime, so that part can print some things out, but might not be finished.
