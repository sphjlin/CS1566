If there are specific requirements needed to run your program, specify them now. Otherwise, just mention how to run the program (a single line command or build with make and run )
in main.c line 117, the location of "vshader.glsl" and "vshader.glsl" need to be changed depending on their new location.
Run the program: open the lab03.xcodeproj and run


Does your program run without error? If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run correctly?:
No errors! If there is an error, in main.c line 117, the location of "vshader.glsl" and "vshader.glsl" need to be changed depending on their new location. Or else, its XCode's fault.:D
